-- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled nulls, converted date/time, and ensured correct datatype formats in Excel.

-- Data Integration: Used unique keys (Patient ID, Appointment ID, Doctor ID) to establish relationships across tables.

-- Dashboard Design (Excel):Created pivot tables for summary statistics.

-- Used slicers and charts (bar, pie, line, radar) for interaction and data segmentation.

-- Applied conditional formatting and color themes for better readability.
